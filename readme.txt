Introduction

Tic Tac Toe game made from scratch by Alexander FÃ¸rsund. I have made this app for educational purposes. None of the functions in this app are copied from other sources or tutorials unless stated.

Purpose of app
I have tried to make this app as modular as possible, where the user can make choices in the option pane to reflect how the game is played. For example it is possible to play player vs player, player vs computer or computer vs computer.


App logic




Future updates
Add difficulty setting for computer - add logic to make smart choices
Live update of settings - possibility to chose player and and difficulty setting on the fly
Choice for automated or clicable iteration through game.
Add backend logic with node.js instead of using local browser storage. This will be used to keep track of users and user data.
Investigate possibilty to create a lobby with users and enable multiplayer mode.
